# coffee-coffee Read-Me

My goal for this project was to implement the basics of web development that I had been learning really for the first time in a "from scratch" website. As such I feel like it did
take me a bit longer with plenty of trial and error, but I feel like I learned a lot. I have started my next project, a React based "E-commerce" website, and I can already tell 
that my approach is a lot more intentional and I am able to move quicker because I am not making the same errors. In this Read Me I will include some of my lessons learned along 
the way. Thanks for visiting!

## The importance of good preparation

Good ux/ui is very important to me, and I have been grateful for the sections from the courses I have taken that have included different design concepts in them. I would not, 
however, consider myself a prolific designer. I spent a good long time struggling over the design on figma and in the end didn't even end up using my figma design for the final
product. This really hampered my progress as I was designing as I went along. I learned that, for my purposes, it is better to rely heavily on inspiration for the design process, 
and focus more on the "how". 

## Really leaning in to flex box and grid

I love flexbox and grid. I think when I started out with this project I was trying to retrofit general css sizing concepts onto flexbox and grid and it just wasn't working.
Once I fully embraced the flexbox and grid models and let them do the sizing for me (and really learn the flex:) property. I was able to have a much cleaner layout that was a 
lot more responsive.

## The intricacies of O Auth

I tried to initialize a few different social media platforms into the site; what I thought would just be a simple "stream" of posts. I ran into a lot of issues with authorization
though and decided that, for my current purposes with the website, it wasn't quite worth it to do a deep dive into implementing a back end (although I am working through a node.js 
course right now and excited to learn more about that! I did walk away from that with a better understanding of some concepts behind keeping websites secure and how authorizations
work for some APIs so I am grateful for that!

## Mobile first is a lot easier

At least for me. I tried making a few changes on the desktop version first and I feel like I always had to do extra work on mobile to make it work and even then go back and fix it
more on the desktop. It's probably more important to just stay consistent but I like mobile first. It makes things simpler. 

## Keeping my CSS organized

While I didn't follow BEM I would say that I was "BEM Inspired". I am really glad that, from the beginning, I decided to do really clear and consistent naming spaces for my
project. This did probably cause me to have some repeated CSS values and for the next project I am already startingn with a list of repeated styles that I can offload to a 
few certain classes and then re-use. 

## Goals for future projects

1. Utilize more Javascript. I accomplished my goal of making a basic web site here, but I know other projects in the future will require a lot more js
2. Continue to make my sites more accessible. I got a decent score on the chrome lighthouse accessibility test and fixed what I could from that feedback, but would like to 
continue to emphasize this.
3. Have a better project workflow. As mentioned above, I wasted a lot of time not having a design in mind. I would like to spend more time designing on the front end so that 
I can get stuck less while doing the actual coding.
